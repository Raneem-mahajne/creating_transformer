# Configuration file for ParityBasedRule
# Rule: If current and previous have same parity → next is even
#       If current and previous have different parity → next is odd

# Configuration name (used for output folder)
name: "parity_based"

# Model architecture
model:
  n_embd: 32          # Embedding dimension (increased from 8 to capture relationships)
  block_size: 16      # Context length (REDUCED - model only needs to see previous 2 tokens for parity rule)

  head_size: 32       # Head size (increased from 16 for more capacity)
